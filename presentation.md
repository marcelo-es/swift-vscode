# What Just Happened??

- Language Server Protocol (LSP) happened
- `Development Tool` <--`LSP`--> `Language Server`
- `VS Code` <--`LSP`--> `SourceKit-LSP`

^
SourceKit-LSP - Built over SourceKit and CLANG

# Back to Swiftin'

^
- Build Tasks - Build
- Jump to definition
- Documentation
- Implement test case of lame Xcode, fail, fix it
- Run, edit launch.json
- Debug, check

---

# GitHub Integration

- Comment on a PR
- Type `.` to Code

---

# Annoyances

* SourceKit-LSP is not feature-complete
  * No background indexing means compilation has to complete in order to index
  * No renaming
  * No formatting
    * Swift-Format was designed to work with SourceKit-LSP
* Also, only SwiftPM projects
